1. mesh model

The 3d object is including 4 parts.

: tv_vintage-model-a_high (as body)
: tv-channel-uhf
: tv-channel-vhf
: tv-screen

so that you can apply custom tv screen textures or keep turn it off.
Also you can rotate tv-channel handles.


2, materials and texture

I set main shader as 'Standard (Specular Setup) for reflecting TV's plastic materials.
Recommended 'Smoothness' (with 'Specular Alpha) is "0.7", but you can change it with your own purposes.

TV uses two materials, one is for TV and the other is tv-screen.
Main tv material uses 'Albedo' and 'Specular' textures and tv-screen material uses 'Albedo' or 'Emission'.
When you see both material 'tv-vintage-model-a-screen' and '-screen-off' you can see the difference.


I'm always accepting any questions and suggestions.

Thank toy and have fun.
