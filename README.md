A 10min long escape room video game in VR.
Developed on Unity for HTC Vive Pro.
See the [demo video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TQV8NwkSOlxkC5OYK4BYYErpCb2BEC06) for a complete run-through of the game.

## VR

* Haptic feedback (controller vibrations)
* physical locomotion (i.e. real-world movement)
* 3D audio
* We engineered and implemented **flying locomotion** by wing flapping, based on fluid dynamics equations : [code](Assets/Scripts/FlyingExp/FlyingExp.cs) and [here](Assets/Scripts/FlyingExp/GetDragForce.cs)

## System requirements

Unity 2018.2. or later.
HTC Vive Pro.
